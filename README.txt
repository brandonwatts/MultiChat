Changes: We made a few minor UI changes just to make the app more streamlined and easier to use which we will highlight below. 

1) We made the maximum users a player could connect be 3. This saves us from throwing an unneeded error.

2) We defaulted a selection for the user so we didnt have any users who didnt answer a question 

3) For the motion stuff we assumed the player was playing with the phone flat on the table and facing him/her. For the submission is the -Z direction, is basically "dropping" the phone face up. Hold the phine in your hand face up and quickly lower the phone towards the floor (This should not take much force at all.)

4) For the game over screen instead of just saying wheather a player won or lost we are also showing the position they came in.
